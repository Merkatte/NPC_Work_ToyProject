# PROGRESS

## Current Status
Codex Code Evaluation(2026-06-30) 결과에서 수정 필요 항목 4건을 적용했다(IMP-018). Guard 씬 엔트리 오배선 수정(High), DestinationProvider null 배열 안전성 추가(Low), WorkerAIManager/MoveAction 정상 경로 Debug.Log 제거(Low), WorkerStats 고정 상수 스타일 정비(Low). 빌드 오류 0, 경고 0 확인. 나머지 4건(Guard 템플릿 완성·모집 트랜잭션·스캔 최적화·stale enum)은 각각 Editor 수동 배선·지갑 구현 연계·프로파일링 후 throttle·직렬화 회귀 위험을 사유로 보류.

## Completed Tasks
| Task ID | Date | Summary | Evidence | Related REQs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| IMP-018 | 2026-06-30 | Codex 평가 결과 적용: Guard 씬 엔트리 오배선 수정(SelectorType 2 → GuardActionSelector fileID 937587168), DestinationProvider null 배열 초기화, WorkerAIManager·MoveAction 정상 경로 Debug.Log 제거(설정 누락 LogWarning 유지), WorkerStats readonly 인스턴스 필드 → const 통합. | `dotnet build Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` 오류 0, 경고 0. Guard 엔트리 YAML grep 확인. Common 폴더 Debug.Log grep → 0건. Codex 리뷰 에이전트 런치(비동기). | Codex Finding 1, 5, 6, 8 |
| IMP-001 | 2026-06-17 | Moved Work/Eat/Drink/Rest duration and stat deltas into WorkerActionResultStatData and injected entries through WorkerActionSet. | `dotnet build Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` succeeded with 0 warnings and 0 errors. | WorkerAI must remain execution-only; action result stats must be data-owned. |
| IMP-002 | 2026-06-17 | Updated WorkerAIManager to inject selector-side WorkerActionSet and connected the SampleScene manager to the Default selector template. | `dotnet build Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` succeeded with 0 warnings and 0 errors; serialized references verified by search. | WorkerAIManager must not require WorkerActionSet on WorkerAI prefabs. |
| IMP-004 | 2026-06-17 | Added wheat carry reward, warehouse destination, and DepositWheat action selected when carried wheat is full. | `dotnet build Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` succeeded with 0 warnings and 0 errors; serialized references verified by search. | Work must produce wheat reward; WorkerAI must remain execution-only; deposit must be a separate action. |
| IMP-005 | 2026-06-19 | Added the initial IAnim contract, animation context/type, MoveAnim hop loop, and WorkAnim squash loop with horizontal flip support. | `dotnet build Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` succeeded with 0 warnings and 0 errors. | DOTween animations must be isolated behind reusable animation implementations. |
| IMP-006 | 2026-06-19 | Added shared animation lookup, per-worker playback control, child visual-root ownership, and Move/Work action playback requests. | Command-line C# build and static prefab/reference checks passed. | WorkerAI must remain animation-agnostic; shared animation definitions must not share per-worker Tween state. |
| IMP-007 | 2026-06-20 | Added the initial CookActionSelector skeleton without coupling it to Farmer's WorkerActionSet. | Command-line C# build passed; selector contract implementation verified statically. | Cook requires a selector boundary before Cook-specific actions and action ownership are introduced. |
| IMP-008 | 2026-06-22 | Added warehouse inventory system: ItemType enum, IInventory contract, WarehouseInventory component, safe carry→warehouse transfer in DepositWheatAction, selector→action IInventory injection pattern. WorkerActionContext unchanged (Worker-only). | `dotnet build Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` succeeded with 0 warnings and 0 errors; scene wiring verified by YAML search (fileID 1903621705 consistent across WarehouseObject components, WarehouseInventory MonoBehaviour, and selector `_warehouse` reference). | REQ-F-022, REQ-F-023, REQ-NF-003. |
| IMP-009 | 2026-06-22 | Reorganized actor scripts into `AI/Friendly/Common`, `Cook`, and `Farmer`, with an `AI/Enemy` root reserved for hostile actors. | Command-line C# build passed with 0 warnings/errors; no duplicate GUIDs or stale old actor paths found; scene/prefab script GUID references remained unchanged. | Architecture responsibility and dependency placement; no gameplay requirement changed. |
| IMP-010 | 2026-06-22 | Added Guard role skeleton: `GuardActionSelector` (clean-start, no Farmer ActionSet coupling), `WallPerimeter` facility marker, `WorkerSelectorType.Guard` enum value. | `dotnet build Assembly-CSharp.csproj --no-restore` passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors. Codex review skipped per user request (token limit). | Guard selector boundary must exist before Guard actions and decision logic are designed; WallPerimeter identifies the guard post location. |

## Implementation Notes
IMP-017: `Assets/Scripts/Recruitment/` 신규 도메인 폴더로 분리해 기존 worker 행동 시스템에 의존하지 않는다. `ResidentCandidateDefinition`은 `ScriptableObject`이므로 Unity truthiness(`if (def)`)로 null 체크한다. 평 C# 인터페이스(`IRecruitmentCostPolicy`, `IResidentSpawner`)는 `== null`/`is null`로 체크한다. `_candidates`는 `List<ResidentCandidateDefinition>`로 관리하며 `IReadOnlyList<IResidentCandidateView>`로 노출된다(`IReadOnlyList<out T>` 공변성 활용). `TryRecruit`에서 `TryPay` 성공 후 spawn 실패 시 골드가 차감된 상태로 남는 한계를 코드에 TODO로 명시했다 — 실제 지갑 구현 시 `Refund` 경로가 필요하다. `IResidentSpawner` 어댑터(WorkerAIManager 연결)는 candidate→WorkerInitialStats 매핑이 미결정이므로 TODO로 경계만 확보했다. `[ContextMenu("Log Candidates")]`로 인스펙터에서 후보 목록을 즉시 확인할 수 있다. AD-012(후보 갱신, 비용 공식, 네임드 중복)는 미결정이므로 이 슬라이스에서 구현하지 않았다.

IMP-016: `PatrolAction.Tick()`의 moveState 분기를 3-way로 변경. `Running`→Running 반환(불변), `Success`→Animation.Stop+idle 전환(불변), `Failed`→Animation.Stop+Failed 반환(신규). 기존 `// 이동 완료 또는 실패 시 idle 단계로 전환` 주석이 오해를 유발했으므로 `// 이동 완료(Success) 시에만 idle 단계로 전환`으로 수정. Cancel·EnemyScanner·idle 로직은 변경 없음.

IMP-015: C# 코드 변경 없이 asset YAML만 수정. `_actionType: 7` 엔트리를 DepositWheat(6) 다음에 추가해 `WorkerActionSet.TryCreateAction(ActionType.Attack)`이 `TryGetResultStatEntry` 성공 경로를 타도록 함. duration은 튜닝 전용 초기값 1초; 전투 데미지·효과는 AttackAction 주입 seam(`IDamageable`, `IAttackPower`)을 통해 별도 조정.

IMP-018: Finding 1 씬 YAML 수정은 `_initialSelectorType: 0`(Default) 상태에서 진행해 런타임 영향 없이 안전. Finding 2(Guard 템플릿 완성)는 Enemy 레이어·프리팹 컴포넌트 부착이 필요한 Unity Editor 작업이라 코드로 처리 불가, 수동 배선 패스로 보류. Finding 3(모집 트랜잭션)은 `AlwaysAffordableCostPolicy`가 no-op이므로 현재 실제 버그 없음, 지갑 구현 연계 시점에 reserve/commit/rollback 설계. Finding 4(EnemyScanner GetComponent)는 10-collider 상한·프로토타입 적 수 소수·Guard 비활성 조건에서 조숙한 최적화, Patrol throttle 과제로 보류. Finding 7(stale enum)은 `ActionType.Sleep` index 3 제거 시 `DefaultWorkerActionResultStatData.asset` raw int 직렬화 회귀 발생 위험, 직렬화 의존 감사 후 처리.

IMP-001: `WorkerAI` was intentionally left unchanged and does not reference `WorkerActionResultStatData`.

IMP-002: CSV/provider abstraction was not added yet; `WorkerActionResultStatData` is the current single source of truth and can be replaced later behind the same lookup role if needed.

IMP-003: `WorkerActionSet` remains selector-side. `WorkerAI` and worker prefabs should not own action pools.

IMP-004: `WorkerAI` remains unchanged for wheat and warehouse behavior. The selector only decides that full carried wheat should trigger `DepositWheat`; `WorkAction` and `DepositWheatAction` perform the state changes through `WorkerCarryStorage`.

IMP-005: `IAnim` implementations create and return DOTween tweens but do not own the active tween lifecycle. `AnimContext.Transform` must be a child visual Transform so MoveAnim local-position changes do not compete with WorkerMover on the actor root. FlipX is applied by preserving scale magnitude and changing only the local X scale sign.

IMP-006: `AnimSet` is shared and stores only stateless definitions. `ActorAnimationController` is created per worker and exclusively owns the mutable active Tween and facing. `MoveAction` and `WorkAction` request animation through `WorkerActionContext.Animation`; `WorkerAI` remains unchanged and animation-agnostic.

IMP-007: `CookActionSelector` intentionally does not implement `IWorkerActionSelectorSetup` because that setup contract injects Farmer's `WorkerActionSet`. It will remain a no-plan selector until Cook-specific actions and their ownership model are defined.

IMP-008: `WorkerActionContext` was intentionally left unchanged. `IInventory` is not a Worker capability — it is an external facility reference. The selector→action injection pattern (identical to `MoveAction` destination) was used instead. `WarehouseInventory` holds a total-capacity limit (not per-ItemType) as the initial choice (user-confirmed). Carry+warehouse both full results in `DepositWheatAction.Failed` with no resource loss; idle/wait policy for that state is out of scope for this slice. `Assembly-CSharp.csproj` was manually updated with new files because Unity has not yet reimported them; Unity regeneration will produce the authoritative csproj. Codex review agent launch was blocked by auto-mode sandbox; user must invoke it manually if desired.

IMP-009: Common contains reusable friendly-AI execution and capabilities, not global game services. Farmer retains `WorkerActionSet`, `WorkerAIManager`, Farmer selectors, `WorkAction`, and `DepositWheatAction` because those currently compose or execute Farmer production. `WorkerCombatActionSelector` remains under Farmer until its action-set dependency is generalized. Moving files preserved their existing `.meta` GUIDs, so serialized script references do not require rewiring.

IMP-010: `GuardActionSelector` intentionally does not implement `IWorkerActionSelectorSetup` because Guard does not yet have its own action set. This mirrors the Cook boundary decision. `WallPerimeter` is a minimal marker; all guard-post logic will be added in later slices when the Guard decision policy is defined. Codex review agent was not launched per user request (token limit).

IMP-013: `Health`는 `MonoBehaviour, IDamageable`로 Worker·적·건물·작물 어디에나 부착 가능하다. `WorkerAI`는 IDamageable을 구현하지 않고 `Health.OnDied`만 구독해 plan을 정리하고 `enabled=false`로 AI 틱을 중지한다. `OnDisable`에서 구독을 해제하므로 씬 언로드·disable 시 이중 처리가 없다. `SeekAction`은 `Physics2D.OverlapCircle(ContactFilter2D)`(Unity 6 non-deprecated)를 사용해 Enemy 레이어를 스캔하며, 전역 적 리스트·매니저 없이 엔진이 공간을 관리한다. `CombatTargetHolder`는 `GuardActionSelector`가 소유하고 SeekAction에 주입·회수한다 — 외부 타깃 정보가 `WorkerActionContext`로 새지 않는 메모리 경계 규칙 준수. 방어력·회피는 현재 `Health` 직렬화 필드로 단순화하고, 향후 ScriptableObject·전략 분리는 두 번째 사용처 확인 후 추출한다. Seek는 매 Tick Physics 질의가 발생하는 구조이므로 적이 없을 때 throttle이 필요하면 별도 작업으로 분리한다. Codex 리뷰 에이전트 실행이 auto-mode 권한 정책으로 차단됐다.

IMP-012: `_registeredActions` 배열을 제거하고 `_resultStatData.ActionTypes`에서 직접 풀을 파생시켰다. 이로써 씬/프리팹 수정 없이 Farmer Critical 회귀가 코드 수준에서 완전 제거된다. Move는 stat 엔트리가 없는 공용 액션이므로 `Awake`에서 명시 등록한다. `RegisterPool`을 idempotent로 만들어 데이터에 실수로 Move가 포함돼도 이중 풀 생성을 방지한다. `IActionSet<TKey>` 삭제: 해당 인터페이스는 `WorkerActionSet`만 구현하며 어디에서도 타입으로 소비되지 않는 죽은 명목 인터페이스였다. Codex가 제안한 High/Medium/Low 항목 중 구조를 깨거나 조숙한 SOLID에 해당하는 것은 수정하지 않았으며, 각 항목의 제외 이유를 계획 문서에 명시했다.

IMP-011: `GuardActionSet` class was not created; instead `WorkerActionSet` was extended so Farmer and Guard share identical pooling logic differentiated only by the serialized `_registeredActions` array. This avoids ~120-line duplication and eliminates drift risk. `WorkerActionSet` stays in its current Farmer folder; relocation to `Common/` would require Unity to regenerate script references in the Farmer prefab and is deferred. `IDamageable` and `IAttackPower` are minimal seams — no concrete enemy or damage-calculation implementation is introduced. `AttackAction` follows the `DepositWheatAction` injection pattern: injections are set before the action starts and cleared on return. Codex review agent was not launched per user request (token limit).

## Next Actions

### Unity Editor 직렬화 연결 (Play Mode 전 필수)
1. **Enemy 레이어 생성**: Project Settings → Tags & Layers → 새 레이어 "Enemy" 추가.
2. **적 테스트 GameObject 만들기**: `Enemy` + `Health` + `Collider2D`(Circle 등) 컴포넌트, 레이어 = Enemy.
3. **가드 prefab에 `Health` + `AttackPower` 부착**, HP/공격력 수치 설정.
4. **Guard selector 템플릿**: `GuardActionSelector` + `WorkerActionSet` 구성.
   - `_scanRadius`(예 6), `_enemyMask`(Enemy 레이어), `_engageRange`(예 1.2)
   - `_patrolRadius`(예 2~3), `_patrolIdleMin`(예 0.5), `_patrolIdleMax`(예 1.5)
   - `_patrolAnchor`: 비워두면 첫 선택 시 스폰 위치 캡처 (또는 명시 Transform 지정)
   - `_destinationProvider`: 가드용 Eat/Drink 목적지 포함 여부 확인
   - `WorkerActionResultStatData` 에셋에 **Attack 엔트리** 존재 확인. ✓ (IMP-015 완료)
5. **`WorkerAIManager`**: `_selectorEntries`에 `{Guard, template}` 추가, 테스트 시 `_initialSelectorType = Guard`.

### Play Mode 검증 항목
- 적 없음 → 가드가 앵커 반경 내를 조금씩 이동하고 가끔 멈춤(얼어붙지 않음).
- 순찰 중 scan 반경 안에 적 등장 → 즉시 이동→공격 → 처치 → 순찰 복귀.
- 순찰 중 Hunger/Thirst 임계 초과 → 음식/물로 이동·회복 → 순찰 복귀.
- 가드 HP 0 → AI 정지(plan Cancel, Tween 정리).
- Farmer도 기존 Eat/Drink/Rest/Work 우선순위 동일하게 동작(WorkerNeedsPolicy 추출 회귀 없음).

### 이후 과제
- **모집 시스템 연결 지점 (IMP-017 이후)**
  - `IResidentSpawner` 어댑터 구현: candidate→WorkerInitialStats 매핑 정의 후 `WorkerAIManager.SpawnWorker`와 연결.
  - 실제 골드/지갑 시스템 구현 시 `IRecruitmentCostPolicy` 교체 + `Refund` 경로 추가.
  - 후보 목록 UI가 준비되면 `RecruitmentManager.Candidates`(`IReadOnlyList<IResidentCandidateView>`)에 직접 바인딩.
  - AD-012 결정 후 후보 갱신 주기·비용 공식·네임드 중복 정책을 `RecruitmentManager`에 추가.
  - `Settlement/Resident Candidate` 메뉴로 `ResidentCandidateDefinition` 에셋 생성 및 `RecruitmentManager._candidateDefinitions`에 할당해 인스펙터 검증.
- **Guard 시스템**
  - `WorkerAIManager` spawn 시 `Health.Init(maxHp, def, dodge)` 주입(스탯 파생 연동, AD-002).
  - Patrol throttle: 매 프레임 Physics 질의 성능 영향 시 n tick 간격 스캔 도입.
  - 욕구 회복 후 patrol anchor가 의도와 다를 경우 anchor re-capture 정책 검토.
  - 성곽(castle wall) 파괴 가능 오브젝트 / 마을 침입 트리거는 별도 슬라이스로 분리.
